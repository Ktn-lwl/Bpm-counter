# Bpm-counter

Hi there! 
I haven't touched C++ in a hot minute so I decided to dust off that little corner of my brain to write some multithreaded code. It's my first time multithreading, so I apologize if my practices make you clutch your pearls ðŸ‘€.
The code contained in this repo is a simple bpm counter to help me when I want to transcribe a song I like or make up into sheet music notation. I _could've_ done this in Python which I'm pretty skilled in, but it seemed easier to rely on C++ for multithreading and collecting hardware input. 

<sub>(I was rusty enough that I thought getchar() returned immediately after you entered a character, but that turned out to be wrong, and was also the main reason I decided to go with C++)</sub>

Writing multithreaded code made me feel cool thoughðŸ˜Ž.
